#One-sentence description of the criterium
text: Do you prevent build of software if it's affected by vulnerabilities in dependencies?

#Order of this question for the activity (in case there would be multiple)
order: 1

#Qualifying Criterion
quality:
- Your build system is connected to a system for tracking 3rd party dependency risk, causing build to fail unless the vulnerability is evaluated to be a false positive or the risk is explicitly accepted
- You scan your dependencies using a static analysis tool
- You report findings back to dependency authors using an established responsible disclosure process
- Using a new dependency not evaluated for security risks causes the build to fail
