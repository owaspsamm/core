practice_maturity_1_description: Review the architecture to ensure baseline mitigations are in place for typical risks.
practice_maturity_2_description: Review the complete provision of security mechanisms in the architecture.
practice_maturity_3_description: Review the architecture effectiveness and feedback results to improve the security architecture.

stream_a: Architecture Validation

stream_a_maturity_1_activity: Identify application and infrastructure architecture components and review for basic security provisioning
stream_a_maturity_2_activity: Validate the architecture security mechanisms
stream_a_maturity_3_activity: Review of the architecture components' effectiveness

stream_b: Architecture Mitigation

stream_b_maturity_1_activity: Ad-hoc review of the architecture for unmitigated security threats.
stream_b_maturity_2_activity: Analyze the architecture for known threats.
stream_b_maturity_3_activity: Feed the architecture review results back into the enterprise architecture, organization design principles & patterns, security solutions and reference architectures.

The Architecture Assessment (AA) practice ensures that the application and infrastructure architecture adequately meets all relevant security and compliance requirements, and sufficiently mitigates identified security threats. The first stream focuses on verifying that the security and compliance requirements identified in the Policy & Compliance and Security Requirements practices are met, first in an ad-hoc manner, then more systematically for each interface in the system. The second stream reviews the architecture, first for mitigations against typical threats, then against the specific threats identified in the Threat Assessment practice.

In its more advanced form, the practice formalizes the security architecture review process, continuously evaluates the effectiveness of the architecture's security controls, their scalability and strategic alignment. Identified weaknesses and possible improvements are fed back to the Security Architecture practice to improve reference architectures.
